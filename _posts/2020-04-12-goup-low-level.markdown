I started to write blog after observing the lack of Azerbaijani contents about low-level stuff (Compiler, Operating system, CPU design). Nowadays, I'm writing blog compiler stuff such as Data-flow analysis, machine-code optimization etc. But, there are already few video series about Hypervisor/VMX and CPU Design in the git repo.
